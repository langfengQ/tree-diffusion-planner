This repository contains the complete code of TAT built upon the pre-trained [Diffuser](https://github.com/jannerm/diffuser). The codes are organized into three separate sub-branches for easy access:

- **Maze2D environment**: access the code directly [here](https://github.com/langfengQ/tree-diffusion-planner/tree/maze2d) (`maze2d` branch).
- **Kuka Block Stacking environment**: access the code directly [here](https://github.com/langfengQ/tree-diffusion-planner/tree/kuka) (`kuka` branch).
- **MuJoCo Locomotion environment**: access the code directly [here](https://github.com/langfengQ/tree-diffusion-planner/tree/locomotion) (`locomotion` branch).

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: the `master` branch does not contain any codes. Please refer to the `maze2d`, `kuka`, and `locomotion` branches for the full implementations.

## üöÄ Quick Start
To get started with this repository, follow these steps:
1. **Clone the repository** and verify the available branches:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/langfengQ/tree-diffusion-planner.git
cd tree-diffusion-planner/
git branch -a
# * master
#   remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
#   remotes/origin/kuka
#   remotes/origin/locomotion
#   remotes/origin/master
#   remotes/origin/maze2d
```
The command `git branch -a` lists all the branches, and you should see the following branches: `master`, `maze2d`, `kuka`, and `locomotion`.

2. **Switch to a specific branch** to access the corresponding environment's code:

For the Maze2D environment:
```bash
git checkout maze2d
# Branch 'maze2d' set up to track remote branch 'maze2d' from 'origin'.
# Switched to a new branch 'maze2d'
```

For the Kuka Block Stacking environment:
```bash
git checkout kuka
# Branch 'kuka' set up to track remote branch 'kuka' from 'origin'.
# Switched to a new branch 'kuka'
```
For the MuJoCo Locomotion environment:
```bash
git checkout locomotion
# Branch 'locomotion' set up to track remote branch 'locomotion' from 'origin'.
# Switched to a new branch 'locomotion'
```

3. **Follow the branch-specific README**: Now you are ready to explore and experiment with TAT in your chosen environment! ü•≥ Then, you can refer to that sub-branch's README file for instructions on setting up the environment, running experiments, and additional configurations.
