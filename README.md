Welcome to the official repository of Trajectory Aggregation Tree (TAT). This repository provides the implementation of TAT on pre-trained [Diffuser](https://github.com/jannerm/diffuser) in three experimental environments, each available in a separate branch. 

- The `maze2d` branch houses the TAT implementation in the Maze2D environment.
- The `kuka` branch houses the TAT implementation in the Kuka Block Stacking environment.
- The `locomotion` branch houses the TAT implementation in the MuJoCo Locomotion environment.
